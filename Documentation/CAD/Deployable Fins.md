# Iteration of Deployable Fins

In this project, it would also be helpful to have deployable fins for this rocket design. 

Pros: 
* Looks cooler to have fins deploy as the rocket leaves the launcher
* 

Cons:
* Could affect the flight pattern 
* might not deploy properly
* 


## Lucia's Design (design A)

This design was made with the intention to house the fins and have them protrude after launch, to give stability to the rocket. This desgin was good in theory, but it had some serious cons that were rectified by cyrus's design.

Cons:
* Clunky and heavy
* no resonable way to secure the fins to the body, (screws were the wrong size for usage on the body)
* The center of pressue was just not far enough back to be stable in flight

Pros:
* would have allowed the rubber band method (securing fins with tension from rubber bands to allow them to spring down after the rocket leaves the tube and/or during flight)
* Longer tail

## Cyrus's Design (design B)
This design proved to be very helpful. This design brought back the center of pressure so much more than the other deployable fin design.

Pros:
* Brings back center of pressure SOO much (way more than design A)
* fins are flush to body 
* open automatically by air drag moving around rocket (does not require rubber band method) 
* lighter and less material
Cons:
* Looks like hellfire missile

It is important to stay aware of the fact that this design now looks like the hellfire R9X missle.
