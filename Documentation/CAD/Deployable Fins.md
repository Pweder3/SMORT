# Iteration of Deployable Fins

In this project, it would also be helpful to have deployable fins for this rocket design. 

Pros: 
* Looks cooler to have fins deploy as the rocket leaves the launcher
* 

Cons:
* Could affect the flight pattern 
* might not deploy properly
* 


## Lucia's Design

This design was made with the intention to house the fins and have them protrude after launch, to give stability to the rocket. This desgin was good in theory, but it ultimately became too cluncky to be able to use reasonably.

## Cyrus's Design
This design proved to be very helpful. This design brought back the center of pressure so much more than the other deployable fin design. It is important to stay aware of the fact that this design now looks like the hellfire R9X missle.
