# Iteration of Deployable Fins

In this project, it would also be helpful to have deployable fins for this rocket design. 

Pros: 
* Looks cooler to have fins deploy as the rocket leaves the launcher
* 

Cons:
* Could affect the flight pattern 
* might not deploy properly
* 


## Lucia's Design

This design was made with the intention to house the fins and have them protrude after launch, to give stability to the rocket. This desgin was good in theory, but it ultimately became too cluncky to be able to use reaspnably.
