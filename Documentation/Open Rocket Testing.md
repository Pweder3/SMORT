# Open Rocket Testing
[Open Rocket Link](https://github.com/Pweder69/SMORT/blob/main/docs/CAD/S.M.O.R.T.%20Shell%20Simulations.ork)
We used Open Rocket to project the balistics of our shell. Open Rocket is a useful tool because it is a very accurate simulation that is very helpful for determining our weight requirements and optimising our rocket before launching. 

## Shell Design

We used the Open Rocket modeling tools to create a shell body that was similar to the rocket that we had in OnShape. For the most part the tools were capable of creating a rocket that is similar to ours we had issues creating some parts like the nose cone. in our OnShape model we have a flat tipped nose cone which is something that we couldn't figure out how to do in Open Rocket.

## Optimal Motor

This link explains motor nomenclature

For our needs we concluded that the B6-4 or the C6-5 motor from Estes would be best suited for our needs. The A8-3 motor is far too weak and while the C6-5 motor does give us better results it isn't recomended that we launch with those motors in our area due to the risk of accidently landing our rockets off the property. But this might not be an issue for our project because our shell is almost double the weight of the reccomended launch weight. We will likely test with both types of motors because they have the same body size.
