## Launch 1

The first launch attempt occurred on Friday, February 9th, 2024. The launch attempted to use the 8-fin design without any of the electronics. We did this because we didn't want to damage any electronics if the shell failed to stabilize in flight. 

### Results

The first attempt was a failure. We believe that we didn't get proper contact between our probes on the shell and the plates in the tube. While this is most likely it is also possible that the igniter failed to detonate. 

### Adjustments

We made the probes on the bottom of the shell a lot more sturdy and tested them with a few different igniters. We also modified the plates so that it was more likely that we get contact.

## Launch 2 

The second launch was attempted on February 15th, 2024 the team rushed into this believing that they had created a solution to their previous issues.



### Results
 This was not the case because once again the rocket failed to launch once again. They also found that their battery mount had penetrated the tube and may have caused issues with the rocket contacting the plates. This may have been the main issue but the team found it more likely that they were simply not getting contact between the probes and the plates.



### Adjustments

The team decided to scrap the old ignition system due to unreliability and because it did not meet the team's standards of aesthetics. In the next week, they decided to make a new system that involved a male and female connector. The male slots into the shell and the female sits in the bottom of the tube. This will allow us to have more consistent contact.

## Launch 3

The third launch was attempted on March 11th, 2024. They again failed to have a successful launch. This was a disappointing failure because they had designed a whole new system that they had a lot of confidence in.

### Results

The team believes that the rocket failed for a few different reasons. First off Paul Weder failed to check the voltage on the batteries that were brought out. Secondly, there was likely a short at the igniter. when the rocket contacted the bottom of the tube the warning light turned off indicating that it either wasn't getting enough current or it had shorted. We think that the latter is more likely. When the team moved to try to do a non-drop launch the motor failed to ignite which is indicative of a short.

### Adjustments

We decided that for the next launch, we would not attempt the drop launch. Paul Weder is no longer allowed to select the batteries that will be used. If we have success with the next launch we will then attempt to launch with electronics. Once all of this is complete we will revisit the drop system.


## Launch 4 / 1st Successful Launch

The fourth launch was the first "successful" launch on March 25th, 2024. 

### Results 

However, to call it a launch would be generous . This was a success in terms of the fact that we had an ignition and the motor started. The rocket itself did not produce any visible upward motion out of the tube. The team tackled most of the existing problems with the previous launches during this launch. This launch was a success in terms of the fact that everything that we set out to do in this launch happened. We brought an extra motor, batteries (tested by Paul with supervision by Lucia, due to past mishaps), and ignitor. During the launch, the rocket was still not recieving proper voltage to engage the ignitor and motor, so we worked toward moving the wires to the outisde of the tube. This worked and the motor and ignitor engaged!

### Adjustments

This is probably the team's biggest step towards improvement so far. The fins of the rocket were completely fried/melted upon engaging of the motor. The fins should have been printed with PETG, but after removing the tube, they had metled in a suspisiously similar way to PLA filament. The other thing that will need to get ironed out before the next launch is the fact that there was no upward movement out of the yube. Calculations need to be double checked and we need to troubleshoot for oher potential problems with liftoff.
