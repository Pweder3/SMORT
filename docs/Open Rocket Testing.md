# Open Rocket Testing

We used Open Rocket to project the balistics of our shell. Open Rocket is a useful tool because it is a very accurate simulation that is very helpful for determining our weight requirements and optimising our rocket before launching. 

## Shell Design

We used the Open Rocket modeling tools to create a shell body that was similar to the rocket that we had in OnShape. For the most part the tools were capable of creating a rocket that is similar to ours we had issues creating some parts like the nose cone. in our OnShape model we have a flat tipped nose cone which is something that we couldn't figure out how to do in Open Rocket.
