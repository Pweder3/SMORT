## Water rocket
pressurized chamber that is burst on impact and releases a large amount of force.

Pros:

- Similar Power and launch distance to a real shell

Cons:

- Not as cool
- Takes a long time to reload the pressure chamber


## Hot wire fuse 

Heat up the firing pin so that when the shell is dropped down the tube it was ignite.

Pros:
- follow up rounds are easy 
- Combustion powered
- 


Cons:
- Need to heat a wire that is strong enough to not break when hit with a motor but is thin enough to heat up enough to ignite the motor.
- 
## Primers

Insert a rocket motor igniter aka. primer/blasting cap [^[1]](https://www.britannica.com/technology/blasting-cap) Into the bottom of a rocket motor so that when it hits the ignition pin the motor will iginite. 

Pros:
- most realistic mechanism to a real motar
- 
Cons:
- Could be considered dangerous
- may need a rebrand
- [why this might not work](https://www.rocketryforum.com/threads/alternative-igniter.154779/#:~:text=Lighting%20a%20hobby%20rocket%20motor,right%20tool%20for%20the%20job).

## Internal Launch Mech

Have the igniter in the rocket motor mounted in the shell. When droped down the barrel the wires that go to the igniter will be bridged and have current flow through them. 

Pros:
- Safe
- Works similarly to a motar
- easily reloadable
Cons:
- Short Launch delay
