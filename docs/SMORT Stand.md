# SMORT Stand
## Design Ideas
There were a couple of different brainstorming ideas for this stand. The first couple of ideas looked a bit like image¹. The other iterations of this design included a comprehensive stand made of 2x4s. This idea morphed into a short stand with a secured axle at the bottom able to rotate to whichever angle we need. The angle range is between -10° and 75°. -10° is just in case we want to shoot the rocket into the ground. But the max is also important because of the safety component, making sure we do not fire the rocket at 90° straight up because then it becomes a HAZARD. 

## Adjustments
After a few attempts (failed), the stand began cracking in a few places and eventually, the entire pipe holder came clean off. This was an unfortunate situation, but with the help of another support in the middle of the base of the tube holder, and a couple of FEA simulations, the stand should be up and running by the next launch. We can easily assume that the main reason we had an issue was because of the lack of FEA simulations. This was an oversight.

The first iteration for the stand ended up being a direct model of the air cannon stand modeled off image². We are also going to put it on a little cart so we can wheel it around, IN A VERY SAFE MANNER. Because there is absolutely nothing inherently dangerous about a rocket launcher on wheels.
