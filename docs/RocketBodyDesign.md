- Seperate the rocket into diffrent parts 
    - The nose cone
    - The body
    - The fins
    - The rocketHolder/Engine\

- Thread the individual parts together such as [Grams and malik rocket](https://github.com/mpascha61/Pi-in-the-Sky)

## Nose cone
Could use a spike to hinder the

## Fins 
- Deployable fins
- Ring with fins inside of it
