- we need to calulate in the loss of fuel mass as the rocket is launched to change the effect on the rockets velocity and eventual positon
-  innital rocket vector is defined as $\vec{V} = v$
- $\hat{i}$ is a unit vector in the x direction 

#  basic simulation of a rocket launch
 - We dont need spacififcs of the rocket mass or fuel mass because our rocket motor is so little mass compared to the rocket
 - We can just use the burn time of the rocket use a initial inerta to calculate the final velocity of the rocket and then subtract the gravity constant.
