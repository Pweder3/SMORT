## Launch 1

The first launch attempt occured on Friday, Febauary 9th. The launch attempted used the 8 fin design without any of the electronics. We did this because we didn't want to damage any electronics if the shell failed to stablize in flight. 

## Results

The first attempt was a failure. We belive that we didnt get proper contact between our probes on the shell and the plates in the tube. While this is most likely it is also possible that the ignighter failed to detonate. 

## Adjustments

We made the probes on the bottom of the shell a lot more sturdy and tested it with a few different ignighters. We also modified the plates so that it was more likely that we get contact.

## Launch 2 

The second launch was attempeted on Febuary 15th the team rushed into this beliving that they had created a solution to their previous issues.



## Results
 This was not the case because once again the rocket failed to launch once again. They also found that their battery mount had penetrated the tube and may have caused issues with the rocket contacting the plates. This may have been the main issue but the team found it more likely that they were simply not getting contact between the probes and the plates.



## Adjustments

The team decided to scrap the old ignition system due to unreliablity and because it did not meet the teams standards of asthetics. In the next week they decided to make a new system that involed a male and female connector. The male slots into the shell and the female sits in the bottom of the tube. This will allow us to have more consistant contact.
